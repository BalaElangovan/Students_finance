# My Final Year Masters Project

## Interactive Dashboard of Student Finance with Integrated Chatbot Support in Dash and Plotly.

**Project Overview**

In this project, I will create a fully interactive dashboard for visualization with Dash and Plotly to analyse students’ finances and help them make better financial decisions using the integrated chatbot.

The main target audience for this project is international students who are starting university. Most international students will struggle to manage their finances at the beginning of the university as they can’t keep track of all their spending and out of excitement they tend to overspend on unnecessary stuff.

My project intends to help the student understand their spending and help them make better financial decisions. I will build a model that takes the user’s (Students’) bank statements as a .csv file and classify their spending with the machine learning algorithm into several simpler categories like family and friends, food, transport, rent, groceries, and shopping.

After exploratory analysis and classification, the dataset will be used to create a fully interactive dashboard in Dash and Plotly to help the student easily understand their spending habits, breaking them down into months and years.

The web application is integrated with a chatbot to help the student make better financial decisions and help students with quick savings tips. The chatbot will be trained to help students with their daily budgets and savings in Transport, food, Accommodation, and mental and financial support.

**The Problem Statement**

International Students who are starting their university will need support in their finances. As leaving the country and starting a new phase of their life in an entirely new country is scary and taunting. So, my project intention is to help international students to better understand finances and help them with any queries regarding savings and finances.

The idea is to get the student’s statement as user input and classify their spending into their respective categories using machine learning and create a fully interactive visually appealing dashboard which breaks down their spending habits and helps them make better decisions with the integrated chatbot which will be trained with the intention to help the students in their budget and savings.

To help the students who are going to start their university, an interactive dashboard report will be built using the data collected from the students who are currently enrolled in the university about their rent, transport expense, food expenses and other necessary expenses. This report will help the students who are waiting to start university to get a better understanding of the incurring expenses.

**Project Aim**

The international student going to start university will have several thoughts and concerns. Among all, Finance is the most taunting one as there is no clear explanation. My project will help the students better understand what to expect before starting their university. The idea is to get the student’s statement as user input and classify their spending into their respective categories using machine learning and create a fully interactive visually appealing dashboard which breaks down their spending habits and helps them make better decisions with the integrated chatbot which will be trained with the intention to help the students in their budget and savings.

To help the students who are going to start their university, an interactive dashboard report will be built using the data collected from the students who are currently enrolled in the university about their rent, transport expense, food expenses and other necessary expenses.
